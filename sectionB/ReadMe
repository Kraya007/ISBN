The program is a typing game where words fall from the top of the screen at different speeds and the user must type them 
correctly before they reach the bottom of the screen. The game continues until either the user types the specified
maximum number of words correctly, misses three words, or quits the game. The user can also pause the game at any point. 

race conditions:
at increase speed multiple tests at different speed, at some speed it showed race conditions when typing a correct word the 
simulation would halt but to ensure such doesn't easily occur I made sure all method  are synchronized and that variable are atomic 

to run:
on an ide just compile all files and run typingtutor app
on linux environment use the makefile and use "java -cp bin typingTutor.TypingTutorApp <totalWords> <noOfWords> <file>"

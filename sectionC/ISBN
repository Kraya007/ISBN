How to run:

To run the program on an IDE, simply compile and run the file.

Automation:

To automate the running of the program, you can create a text file containing ISBNs and return a redirection file of valid or 
invalid. Due to the lack of testing data, an array was assumed to be suitable. Please excuse me on that.

Complexity:

The best-case complexity for the program is O(1) because every operation takes a constant time operation such as removing spaces 
and hyphens, checking the ISBN format, and calculating the number for the ISBN.

The worst-case complexity is O(n). Hypothetically, if you were to increase the input size in terms of more ISBNs, the 
complexity would change linearly. In this program, converting the ISBN numbers results in O(n), but this renders our best-case 
complexity irrelevant since if we were to add up O(1) + O(1) + O(n) = O(n).

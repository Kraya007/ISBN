Java Support Task

To successfully guide the student out of the bug, I will firstly ask the student to walk me through the task background to ensure
if they understand the task. Then, they will walk me through the code they have written in an attempt to solve Task 6 and help me 
understand the root of the problem on the JOptionPane issue. Then, I will ask the student what they expect or rather what their 
desired output behavior is when using JOptionPane.showDialog().
I will confirm if their expectation corresponds with what the function is supposed to do. Once I have a clear understanding of 
the student's problem, I will ask for the student to share their screen so I can see the code. Then, I will perform a step-over 
bug tracking method line to line to find the exact or identify the error.
I will examine the error and implement a solution and clearly explain the solution to the student and walk them through 
the possible changes. I will ask the student to test the updated code to ensure their issue has been solved. Thereafter, 
I will do a follow-up with the student to check if they have more problems or check on their progress and encourage them to be
in touch if they encounter any difficulties again.

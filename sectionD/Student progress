 Student progress

For the 5 students who are two weeks behind, my intervention plan will be to firstly have a one-on-one conversation and try to find
out what's the root of the problem. Are there any personal (family or health) obstacles, or is the task at hand very challenging,
or just a lack of will? Then, based on the information they have given, I will devise a customized plan for each student by 
offering daily sessions, frequent short achievable goals, and providing instant feedback to encourage commitment. 
This will allow me to conduct regular check-ins easily to gauge student engagement, thus ensuring they stay on track in order 
to cover those two weeks.
For the 10 students who are at risk of falling behind as I mentor, my intervention plan will be to layout the expectations of the 
upcoming tasks and emphasize the time needed to complete these tasks. In this specific case, a group session will be advantageous 
to recognize each student's strengths and encourage collaboration to complement their strengths and weaknesses while I subtly 
monitor their progress to ensure they receive additional support to stay on track on what's expected from them.
For the 5 students who are ahead of their time, I will look at their completed work and find ways to challenge them to expand on 
their solutions by encouraging more rigor and creativity. To encourage them to stay engaged and motivated, I will also encourage 
these five students to engage in peer support for students who haven't completed, thus reinforcing their understanding of the tasks.
I will also monitor their engagement so they don't get bored and keep avid for the next tasks.
